# Don't use this pro file for building project!!!
# I made this hack for creation one TS file for whole project.
# Because we have several libraries that also have strings for translation, have several TS files for each
# subproject annoying.
#
# Original idea "How to generate a single translation file for a large Qt project?"

# Add here path to new translation file with name "valentina_*_*.ts" if you want to add new language.
# Same paths in variable INSTALL_TRANSLATIONS (translations.pri).

# File measurements_*.ts we use in transifex.com. It is empty translation file only with english inside.
# transifex.com use this file like base for new language. Don't add path to measurements_*.ts to INSTALL_TRANSLATIONS
# variable (app.pro).
# When adding a translation here, also add it in the macx part (translations.pri).
