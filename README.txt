Valentina
==========
Valentina is a cross-platform patternmaking program which allows designers 
to create and model patterns of clothing. This software allows pattern 
creation, using either standard sizing tables or an individualâ€™s set of 
measurements. It blends new technologies with traditional methods to create 
a unique pattern making tool. 

Supported Platforms
===================
The standalone binary packages support the following platforms:

Windows XP SP2 (32-bit) or later
Ubuntu Linux 14.04 (32-bit/64-bit) or later
OpenSUSE 13.02 (32-bit/64-bit) or later
Fedora 24 (32-bit/64-bit) or later
Mac OS X 10.8 (64-bit) or later

Building the sources requires Qt 5.2.0 or later.

Compiling Valentina
====================
Prerequisites:   
   * Qt 5.2.0 or later (On Unix development packages needed)   
   * mercurial (only for working with repository)   
   * On Unix:     
     - g++ (at least GCC 4.7 is needed and GCC 4.8 is recommended) or
       clang (clang 3.4 recommended)
     - xpdf package (tool pdftops).    
   * On Windows:   
     - MinGW  
     - Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) 
     files. Website http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/. Put tool pdftops.exe 
     in the same directory with Valentina's binary file.

The installed toolchains have to match the one Qt was compiled with.

You can build Valentina with

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY\build
    qmake ..\Valentina.pro -r CONFIG+=noDebugSymbols CONFIG+=no_ccache
    make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Note: On some platforms e.g. Fedora, all Qt-tools come as qmake-qt5 
    etc. In this case you should install qtchooser. This wrapper 
    resolves the Qt version with respect to QT_SELECT. So run 

    export QT_SELECT=5

    prior to qmake. You will not come along with just using qmake-qt5
    here.


Note:In order to build and use Valentina, the PATH environment variable 
needs to be extended:

 PATH               - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools
This is done by adding c:\Qt\%VERSION%\bin to the PATH variable.

For newer versions of Windows, PATH can be extended through the 
Control Panel|System|Advanced|Environment variables menu.

You may also need to ensure that the locations of your compiler and 
other build tools are listed in the PATH variable. This will depend on 
your choice of software development environment.

Unix systems:
Default prefix for command "make install" is /usr. For using another 
prefix build with qmake command:

qmake PREFIX=/usr/local PREFIX_LIB=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu Valentina.pro -r CONFIG+=noDebugSymbols CONFIG+=no_ccache

where /usr/local is a new prefix for installation binary files and /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu is new prefix for install libraries.
