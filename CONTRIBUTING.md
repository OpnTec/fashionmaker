This page describes how to create a pull request. We highly recommend you to read this page before you will decide to send us your changes.

## Branches

First you should know little bit about our workflow.

* *master* - used only for major releases.
* *develop* - branch that contains a code for the next major release. Code in this branch good enough for testing and sharing among developers.
* *vz.y.x* - pattern for branch name, where z and y represents branch version. For example v0.6.x. Such branches will contain for stable versions. Look there for bugfixes for current stable version.

You allowed to create a branch to later merge with develop branch.
