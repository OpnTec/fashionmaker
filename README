Valentina
==========
Open source project of creating a pattern making program, whose allow 
create and modeling patterns of clothing. 

Supported Platforms
===================
The standalone binary packages support the following platforms:

Windows XP SP2 or later
Ubuntu Linux 11.10 (32-bit) or later

Building the sources requires Qt 5.0.0 or later.

Compiling Valentina
====================
Prerequisites:
   * Qt 5.0.0 or later (On Unix development packages needed)
   * mercurial
   * On Unix:
     - ccache
     - g++ (at least GCC 4.6 is needed and GCC 4.8 is recommended)
   * On Windows:
     -  MinGW or Visual Studio

The installed toolchains have to match the one Qt was compiled with.

You can build Valentina with

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
    qmake -r
    make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Note:In order to build and use Valentina, the PATH environment variable 
needs to be extended:

 PATH               - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools
This is done by adding c:\Qt\%VERSION%\bin to the PATH variable.

For newer versions of Windows, PATH can be extended through the 
Control Panel|System|Advanced|Environment variables menu.

You may also need to ensure that the locations of your compiler and 
other build tools are listed in the PATH variable. This will depend on 
your choice of software development environment.
