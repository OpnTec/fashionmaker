There are some steps required to create your own docker image.

1. Have a Docker hub account, https://hub.docker.com/
2. Install docker.io package on 64 bit system. 
3. Create a Dockerfile. You will find one in this directory.
4. Build the image from Dockerfile.
5. Push the image to Docker hub.
6. Specify the image in your bitbucket-pipelines.yml file

As documented here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Use+Docker+images+as+build+environments+in+Bitbucket+Pipelines

You can use your image on a top level as well as on a specific step like this.
