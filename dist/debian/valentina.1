.SH NAME
Valentina \- Pattern making program.
.SH SYNOPSIS
valentina [options] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Valentina
is a cross-platform patternmaking program which allows designers 
to create and model patterns of clothing. This software allows pattern 
creation, using either standard sizing tables or an individual’s set of 
measurements. It blends new technologies with traditional methods to create 
a unique pattern making tool.
