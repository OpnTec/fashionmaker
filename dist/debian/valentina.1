.SH NAME
valentina \- Pattern making program.
.SH SYNOPSIS
valentina [options] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Valentina
is a cross-platform patternmaking program which allows designers 
to create and model patterns of clothing. This software allows pattern 
creation, using either standard sizing tables or an individualâ€™s set of 
measurements. It blends new technologies with traditional methods to create 
a unique pattern making tool.
